## My Journey: Becoming a Developer

My journey in the tech world has been an exhilarating blend of creativity and problem-solving. As a software developer, my true passion lies in crafting innovative solutions to tackle complex challenges head-on.

Before embarking on this path, I graduated from Wheaton College, a prestigious school, with a bachelors in business. Not long after, I had the privilege of serving as a project manager at a small software development and web design company. There, I collaborated closely with a talented team of designers and developers to bring to life a remarkable web application for none other than British Petroleum. The experience was both gratifying and enlightening, as I witnessed the power of technology in assisting businesses and consumer experience.

However, a pivotal moment came when I realized that I craved something more profound from my career. I observed the developers on my team and how they created amazing tools from scratch. This sparked the desire to make a tangible impact, to aid those in need, and to take on intricate problems headfirst. This desire ultimately fueled my decision to transition into a dedicated software development professional.

By delving into this dynamic field, I knew I could harness my creativity and problem-solving acumen to build tools that genuinely assist people and address challenging issues. The thought of contributing my skills to make the world a better place through software development filled me with unwavering determination.

As I continue to grow in my software development journey, I eagerly anticipate the countless opportunities to make a difference and positively impact the lives of others.
